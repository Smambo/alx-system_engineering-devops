## Postmortem

Incidents happen. They just do. As our systems grow in scale and complexity, failures are inevitable. Incidents are also a learning opportunity. 

A chance to uncover vulnerabilities in your system. An opportunity to mitigate repeat incidents and decrease time to resolution. A time to bring your teams together and plan for how they can be even better next time. 

The best way to work through what happened during an incident and capture any lessons learned is by conducting an incident postmortem, also known as a post-incident review.
