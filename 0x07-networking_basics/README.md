What is the OSI model?

1. Set of specifications that network hardware manufacturers must respect
2. The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology
3. The OSI model is a model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system with a strong regard for their underlying internal structure and technology

How is the OSI model organized?

1. Alphabetically
2. From the lowest to the highest level
3. Randomly

Questions:

What is a MAC address?

1. The name of a network interface
2. The unique identifier of a network interface
3. A network interface

What is an IP address?

1. Is to devices connected to a network what postal address is to houses
2. The unique identifier of a network interface
3. Is a number that network devices use to connect to networks

### [3.UDP and TCP](./3-UDP_and_TCP)
![UDP and TCP](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2020/9/3d92e3c4a470f8ecf4c73db511fcbbadaa002e1c.jpg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20231004%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20231004T135034Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=5395c201ec69dc49e9f4ae23eefa06ec8cd25fbc35b1282d77881352c04ae1d8)

Letâ€™s fill the empty parts in the drawing above.

Questions:

Which statement is correct for the TCP box:

1.  `It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely`
2.  `It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process`

Which statement is correct for the UDP box:

1.  `It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely`
2.  `It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process`

Which statement is correct for the TCP worker:

1.  `Have you received boxes x, y, z?`
2.  `May I increase the rate at which I am sending you boxes?`

### [4.TCP and UDP ports](./4-TCP_and_UDP_ports)
Write a Bash script that displays listening ports:

* That only shows listening sockets
* That shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs

### [5.Is the host on the network](./5-is_the_host_on_the_network)
Write a Bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument.

Requirements:

* Accepts a string as an argument
* Displays `Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS}` if no argument passed
* Ping the IP 5 times
